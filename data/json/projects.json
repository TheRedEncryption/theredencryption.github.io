In addition to all of that, nearly every graphic was made in MS Paint, as I was working on this from a very limited school computer that only allowed whitelisted programs.",

I did not have a lot of Lua experience at the time, so I was quite elated at the fact that I could release something. InfiniRun boasts random tiles, across which you have to run, with different obstacles in a top down view while you run from a wall that's chasing you. There are multiple times of day: Day, Night, and Blood Moon, which change the difficulty of the game. The game has four original sountracks, as well, and you can find InfiniRun <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/15838840401\" target=\"_blank\">on Roblox.</a>",

It's a simple UI-based card matching game on Roblox, complete with calm sounds and an aesthetic that's not aggressive to the eyes, and in the making of this project, I learned all about how the different UI systems and containers of Roblox worked, and how they can interact with scripting in Lua.

From the development of TOREADOR, I've learned that it's important to set reasonable expectations while developing, but in terms of platform-specific development, I've learned a lot about how state can be managed in Roblox and Lua, and how one can intertwine several different types of 3D gameplay into a cohesive product. <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/16772219444/\" target=\"_blank\">TOREADOR</a> is available to play on Roblox.",

The game is an RPG (reminiscent of Zelda and based entirely on dogs) that was made in Godot, and I learned about the quirks of the engine and the intricacies of GDScript. I worked on UI, player health mechanincs, some enemy AI, as well as other world-related things like chests and item types. I had used Git before for version controling my own personal projects, but in GADIG, I learned of the proper way one interacts with a team in the creation of a game.
