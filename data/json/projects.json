As it stands, there is only support for 16 notes per bar, with the notes being either empty, small, or big. You can use the editor <a href=\"https://theredencryption.github.io/tre-taiko-editor/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a> I learned a lot about HTML Canvas during the development of this project, as well as how one can handle on-screen button inputs, file creation, manipulation, and exporting of said file. In addition to all of that, nearly every graphic was made in MS Paint, as I was working on this from a very limited school computer that only allowed whitelisted programs.",

I did not have a lot of Lua experience at the time, so I was quite elated at the fact that I could release something. InfiniRun boasts random tiles, across which you have to run, with different obstacles in a top down view while you run from a wall that's chasing you. There are multiple times of day: Day, Night, and Blood Moon, which change the difficulty of the game. The game has four original sountracks, as well, and you can find InfiniRun <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/15838840401\" target=\"_blank\">on Roblox.</a>",
